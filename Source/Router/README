# Router

Is a command line tool that exposes a proxy server that proxies requests to the correct port on the correct pod based on the request url.
 `/proxy/application/environment/microservice/path`

## Config

`proxy` is the configuration for the proxy command, it defines the port that it should run on, how to get the tenant id header from the request and where to find the correct port to route to.

`kubernetes` is the configuration for how the router listens to pods in Kubernetes.

  format: console
